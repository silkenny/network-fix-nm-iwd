# Contributing to Network Fix: NetworkManager & iwd

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project! This guide will help you get started.

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/network-fix-nm-iwd.git`
3. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
4. Make your changes
5. Test thoroughly
6. Submit a pull request

## üß™ Testing

### Local Testing

Before submitting changes, please test on multiple distributions:

**Required Tests:**
- Test on a clean system with both NetworkManager and iwd installed
- Verify the fix works correctly
- Test the restore functionality
- Check the status script provides accurate information

**Testing Script:**
```bash
# Test the fix
sudo ./fix-network.sh

# Verify functionality
./check-status.sh
nmcli device wifi list

# Test restoration
sudo ./restore-network.sh

# Verify restoration
./check-status.sh
```

### Test Environments

Please test on at least one of these distributions:
- Arch Linux
- Fedora 38+
- Ubuntu 22.04+
- openSUSE Tumbleweed

### Virtual Machine Testing

For safety, use virtual machines with Wi-Fi passthrough or USB Wi-Fi adapters for testing.

## üìù Code Standards

### Bash Scripting Guidelines

1. **Use strict mode**: `set -euo pipefail`
2. **Quote variables**: Use `"$variable"` instead of `$variable`
3. **Check command existence**: Use `command -v cmd` before using commands
4. **Handle errors gracefully**: Implement proper error handling and cleanup
5. **Use meaningful function names**: Functions should be self-documenting
6. **Comment complex logic**: Explain why, not what

### Style Guide

- **Indentation**: 4 spaces (no tabs)
- **Line length**: Maximum 100 characters
- **Function naming**: Use snake_case for functions
- **Variable naming**: Use snake_case for variables
- **Constants**: Use UPPER_CASE for constants

### Example Code Style

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -euo pipefail

# Constants
readonly SCRIPT_DIR="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" && pwd)"
readonly LOG_FILE="${SCRIPT_DIR}/logs/operation.log"

# Function with proper error handling
backup_configuration() {
    local config_file="$1"
    local backup_name="$2"
    
    if [[ ! -f "$config_file" ]]; then
        log_error "Configuration file not found: $config_file"
        return 1
    fi
    
    if ! cp "$config_file" "${BACKUP_DIR}/${backup_name}.backup"; then
        log_error "Failed to backup $config_file"
        return 1
    fi
    
    log_info "Successfully backed up $config_file"
    return 0
}
```
